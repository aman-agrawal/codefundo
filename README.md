FLOOD DETECTION IDEA:
--------------------
Continuously monitoring the level of waterbody (using rain gauges) through satellite and analysing information from rain and weather forecasting data of future days/months to depict level of water in future days/months, and hence set a threshold from historical flood data and flood maps to predict chances of flood in regional areas. Track high flooded areas using radar images and continuously monitoring the water level with threshold.

TECHNICAL MODEL:
-----------------
1. Design an app which display weather statistics, have alert by alarms system, notification system.
2. Use of AI and image processing by cross calibration/normalization method to monitor water level.
3. Use statistics to set dynamic threshold value and probability to predict flood.
4. Use of learning algorithms to analyse flood historical data.
5. Set up water gauges and flood detection systems in various areas after geographical study of patterns of urbanisation and accumulation to prevent high flooded areas from loses. 
6. Use of Multi temporal visualization of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images to monitor high flooded areas.
7. Use data fusion to fuse pre-disaster and post-disaster images into a color image for better identity.
8. Use of fuzzy logic to analyse statistics of humidity vs flood, wind vs flood, tides vs flood, rainfall vs flood.
